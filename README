This repository contains C code exploring a new BSD system.
I make no garuntee about that this code will be of use to anyone other than
myself.  

The goal of this project is to write a C module to query machine battery
state.  To do this I use FreeBSD's sysctl system call. After writing this 
module I discovered an alternate approach using ioctl vs sysctl.  

For more details about this alternate approach look @ FreeBSD's source for the
`apciconf` utility. The source can be found in
/src/usr.sbin/acpi/acpi/acpiconf/acpiconf.c

NOTE: The makefile as of yet is still very much connected to FreeBSD's
templates and likely wont be nice to work with until I break out a
project-specific makefile.
